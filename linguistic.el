;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Carry out basic linguistic / text analysis on buffers
;; with word frequency, bigrams, trigrams and collocation.
;;
;; Usage:
;; `linguistic-word-freq' and `linguistic-grams-freq' return frequencies ready to plot.
;; `linguistic-collocation' returns word occurrences in context.
